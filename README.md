## Understanding the Problem Statement:
The amount of the premium for a health insurance policy depends from person to person, as many factors affect the amount of the premium for a health insurance policy. Letâ€™s say age, a young person is very less likely to have major health problems compared to an older person. Thus, treating an older person will be expensive compared to a young one. That is why an older person is required to pay a high premium compared to a young person.Just like age, many other factors affect the premium for a health insurance policy. Hope you now have understood what health insurance is and how the premium for a health insurance policy is determined.

The goal of this project is to give people an estimate of how much they need based on their individual health situation. After that, customers can work with any health insurance carrier and its plans and perks while keeping the projected cost from our study in mind. This can assist a person in concentrating on the health side of an insurance policy rather han the ineffective part.

## Data Collection & understanding :
The dataset is collected from the following link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/noordeen/insurance-premium-prediction

The dataset that I am using for the task of health insurance premium prediction is collected from Kaggle.

This dataset contains 1338 observations (rows)
7 features (columns).
The dataset contains 4 numerical features and 3 nominal features.
1 target feature i.e expenses.
## Features in Datasets: :
age : int - the age of the person
sex : object - gender of the person
bmi : float - Body Mass Index of the person
children : int - how many children the person is having
smoker : object - whether the person smoke or not
region : object - the region where the person lives
expenses : float - the prememium amount of the insurance policy

## Conclusion
This Project which predicts the amount of the insurance premium based on different parameters (like Age,BMI etc) for a particular person can be implemented practically and used by Insurance Comapnies in real life. This will help the companies to predict the estimate for Insurance premium for a particular person by considering the risk involved for that particular person.
